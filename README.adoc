Mod-it library provides an API to ease creations of EMF Models in XTend.

== Rationale

When embedding models into code (mostly for tests), developers usually struggles with 2 
strategies:

 * Using resource source and weighing the project with
 ** Hard-to-read/edit/merge content
 ** Very repetitive
 ** Stale version
 * Using code and undergo
 ** Unfriendly EMF syntax
 ** Sequential descriptions of hierarchical elements
 ** declare-before-reference constraints

This library frees developers of tedious EMF factory syntax making model description
similar to a JSon file with compilation check.
It also suppresses the constraint of sequential code by providing a registry mechanism 
and resolving references in an assembling phase.

Using such syntax helps to:

 * Speed up the creation of tests,
 * Improve the readability of the tests,
 * Improve maintainability when the tested meta-model changes
 * Ease the creation of interconnected models

It has been created and used in industrial projects to ease the creation input for JUnit 
tests on the meta-model and business rules.

== Content

It comes with various features:

 * EModit: EMF model factory API.

 * EReversIt generates Xtend sources from existing models providing:
 ** Efficient tool to convert existing project resource,
 ** Round-trips for manual tests to automatic test process.
 
 * EMF Resource factory extension provides dynamic content as an EMF Resource.
 ** Using plugin URI ending with '.modit', you can target class creating EMF models.
 
 * EMF Sirius integration to write Sirius model in textual mode and lambda in XTend 
 (avoiding text|not-compiled queries).
 ** SiriusReverseIt can generated classes from an existing ODesign.

 * EMF enrichment where user can associate properties and lambda to meta-model and 
 providing pseudo multi-inheritance for EObject.
 
 * i18n classes to use Xtend template instead of properties syntax.
