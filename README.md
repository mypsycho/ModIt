# Mod-it [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mypsycho/ModIt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mypsycho/ModIt)

Mod-it library provides an API to ease creations of EMF Models in XTend.

EMod-it extension frees developers of tedious EMF factory syntax making model description close to JSon file.
It also suppresses the sequential constraint of code by providing a registry and resolving references afterward.

It comes with reverse engine EReversIt which generated Xtend class from existing models.  

Using such syntax helps to:
 * Speed up the creation of tests
 * Improve the readability of the tests
 * Improve maintainability when the tested metamodel changes
 * Ease the creation of inter-connected models

It has been created and used in industrial project to ease the creation input for JUnit tests on the metamodel and business rules.
