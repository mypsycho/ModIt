= Feedback: Building a DSL with Eclipse Sirius 
:source-highlighter: highlightjs
:revealjs_center: true
:customcss: compact.css

:title-slide-background-image: images/emf_logo.png

* _Project Overview_

* _Structural organization (in-short)_

* _Eclipse plugins development_



== Project overview

Convert Rational Rose Extensions into Eclipse 
plugins

* From UML stereotypes to Ecore classes

Targeted DSL was broad:

* 300+ classes, 350+ properties

* A lot of Stereotype packages transformed into 4 
Emf Packages

=== Edition features

* Few types of diagrams were expected (4)
  
* but all properties to edit through Sirius:EEF and 
dispatched in 4 tabs.



== Structural organization 

In-short (not the focus)

* Code: Maven/tycho, gerrit, Jenkins, Oomph, 

* Doc/management: Jira/Confluence _Model-Driven agile_

=== Notable elements

A replicable structure for POM as the project are 
divided in 3 Gits

Layout files to keep consistency between Oomph 
descriptors and Maven/Typho TPD

Reproducing Eclipse Nature philosophy in POMs 
using POM Parent and profile

* For example: Xtend or projecting including code 
generation



== Development: Limits of model-driven approach

* Using Genmodel

* Writing Sirius Model

=== Using Genmodel

A lot a boiler plates in code and hard to identify 
specific from mundane.

Poor handling of multi-inheritance.

Even with EmfLoopHole, customization of 
ItemProviderAdapter is painful.

Editing plugin.properties file was laborious du to 
size.

=== Writing Sirius Model

(Un)Fortunately so repetitive 

* Able/Compelled to dev of a creation wizard. [ :-( ]

* As one-shoot strategy, wizard lacks flexibility 
when modifying Meta-Model.

**Resulting ODesign is huge !**



== Retrospective analysis

Needs and constraints:

=== Needs ?

Extend meta-model in seamless way with the 
implementation.

Avoid generation for customization an Ecore 
Element.

Modifications of meta-model leads to compilation 
errors.

=== Constraints

Different aspects should be attached in a readable 
unit of code: 

No structural switch splitting functional rules.

Be able to choose between:

** grouping by feature (validation, edition, ...)

** grouping by semantic (package or EClass) 

For 1 element, Display, validation or actions could 
be in 1 class.



== Proposition

Extending meta-model by code:

* Readable syntax (no eAnnotation).

* Real typed-approach: no symbolic code like in 
plugin.xml extensions.

=== Expected code

[source,scala]
----
XxNamedElement += #[ // A Emf Class is extended
  String->[XxNamedElement| name ], // ItemProvider label provider
  Diagnostic->#[ // Validation Defining validation rule
    "EmptyName"->error->[XxNamedElement| name==null || name.trim.empty ],
    "HiddenCar"->warning->[XxNamedElement| name!=null && name.trim != name ],
  ]
]
// Extended features
//   EEF: Property accepts carriage return.
abstractConstrainedMethod_Precondition += multiline
abstractConstrainedMethod_Postcondition += multiline
abstractError_QualifiedName += shown
abstractError_Domain += shown
abstractExtendedReturningMethod_ReturnTypeDocumentation += #[ Tab->Tab.documentation, multiline ]
abstractReturningMethod_ReturnTypeDocumentation += #[ Tab->Tab.documentation, multiline ]
//   EEF: Property in a specific category.
abstractRootElement_StandardGeneration += Tab->Tab.generation
abstractRootElement_ErrorGeneration += Tab->Tab.generation
abstractType_AllAttributes += hidden

== How to use

Project https://github.com/mypsycho/modit

Extending BOEM approach: model-by-code.

=== Available API 

A singleton of EmfStrecher works on a group of 
EPackage, registers specificities and provides 
inheritance mechanism.

EmfContribution provides a factory to wrap singleton 
creation and initialization.

Major features (edit, validated, etc) can supported
by 1 engine based on EmfContribution keys and 
running  with an EmfStrecher.

=== Example for Sirius

Definition of singleton: EqxModelExtensions

Contribution of model: EquinoxeCoreContrib, 
EquinoxeComposantsMetierContrib, ...

link:https://github.com/mypsycho/ModIt/tree/master/tests/reversit-tests/src-gen/fr/ibp/odv/xad2/rcp/model[code sample]

Engine of Sirius (limited to EEF part): 1 simple 
class (<500 lines).

link:https://github.com/mypsycho/ModIt/blob/master/tests/reversit-tests/src/org/mypsycho/emf/modit/reverit/test/SiriusGenerator.xtend[SiriusGenerator]



== Complements

Other available elements:

=== Reverse existing models

For Genmodel, Sirius, test resources, ...

EReversIt generates Xtend classes matching any 
EMF model.

Eases detection of pattern in models.

Use case: **Round-trip with Sirius**

* Edit in run mode

* Reverse to code

* Update engine accordingly

=== I18n with Xtend

Syntax of i18n Edit plugin or Eclipse is messy and 
limited.

Xtend syntax leads to a Class-based approach. 

Typed approach (not only String).

Using Xtend template instead of tricky pseudo 
MessageFormat.



== Possible complements

* ItemProviderAdapterFactory _In progress_
** Customizable endlessly (unlike genmodel).
** Functions have a overridable behavior.

* Other fields of interest: Validation, actions ...

* Existing POC: EEF Group for Sirius.
